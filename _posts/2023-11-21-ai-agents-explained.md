## What are AI Agents?

AI agents are autonomous entities that perceive their environment through sensors and act upon that environment through actuators...

### Key Components

1. **Perception**: How the agent receives input
2. **Reasoning**: How the agent processes information
3. **Action**: How the agent affects its environment

```python
class SimpleAIAgent:
    def __init__(self):
        self.knowledge = []
        
    def perceive(self, observation):
        self.knowledge.append(observation)
        
    def act(self):
        if "problem" in self.knowledge[-1]:
            return "solve_problem"
        return "wait"
